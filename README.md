# VPN IP Display
a simple script that can be plugged into a cmd applet to display your vpn ip on a panel / taskbar.

## Why though?
This is nothing special really. just a script I wrote to fix a simple inconvience of having to look up my VPN IP everytime is was connected.
I mostly put this on github so I can have access to it across mutliple devices but made it public incase anyone else finds it useful.


## Setup
I've used this on KDE / XFCE though I'm sure it works on a majority of other DEs. Just download the bash script, change the file permissions 
to allow execution from the process like so.


    chmod 711 /path/to/the/script
    
Than just add it to your panel / taskbar and it should be operational
